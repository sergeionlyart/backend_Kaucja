# Local Fixtures Policy

This directory is for local manual/integration test documents only.

Rules:
- Put test files under `fixtures/` locally (for example: `fixtures/1/*.pdf`, `fixtures/1/*.jpg`).
- Do not commit real documents, screenshots, or temporary OS files.
- Keep only this `README.md` in Git.

Suggested local structure:

```text
fixtures/
  README.md
  1/
    sample-1.pdf
    sample-2.jpg
```
